      <description>Abstract Quantum computing is a field that combines concepts from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. Following Richard Feynman&amp;rsquo;s finding that certain quantum mechanical effects cannot be efficiently replicated on a computer, it was hypothesized that computation, in general, could be more efficient if these quantum effects were exploited. When Peter Shor described a polynomial-time quantum technique for factoring integers, this speculation was confirmed. Since then time, the field of Quantum Computing has been in the mainstream and has been widely discussed.</description>
